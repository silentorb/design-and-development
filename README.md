# Elegant System Design

By Christopher W. Johnson

## The Lofty and the Lowly

In all of life there is a tension between the lofty and the lowly, the extraordinary and the ordinary.  The ideal person is one who pursues ever greater heights in ability and accomplishment, yet is also humble.  Someone who reaches for the stars, yet is keenly aware that the universe is infinitely bigger than he is.  Someone who is always deepening in understanding, and has no problem taking out the trash.

This equally applies to system design.  The most useful systems are systems that incorporate tremendous insight and discipline, but are humble and don't get in the way.
