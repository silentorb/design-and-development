# Elegant System Design

By Christopher W. Johnson

## The Lofty and the Lowly

### Background

In all of life there is a tension between the lofty and the lowly, the extraordinary and the ordinary.  Systems work best when they are accomplishing amazing things yet are humble.  Reaching for the stars yet keenly aware that the universe is infinitely bigger.  Deepening in understanding and happy to take out the trash.

This equally applies to system design.  The most useful systems are systems that incorporate tremendous insight and discipline, but are humble.

### Rules

* Pursue excellence
* Serve others through your creation

## Man and Machine

> "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath." - Mark 2:27b

### Background

Humanity is creative.  Humanity creates tools to assist humanity and further creation.

A creation is an extension and reflection of its creator.

Humanity has a tendency to utilize the reflective-nature of creation and exalt themselves through their creations.

When the creation of a tool becomes more self than service, the utility of that tool diminishes.

Pride is a subtle force; felt by all and noticed by few.

The gravitational force of pride increases in proportion to the excellence of the tool being created.

Designers should strive to craft excellent systems, but the more they succeed, the more dangerous that success becomes.

### Rules

* Don't shoot low, but know that the higher you climb, the harder it is to keep from falling

* Be ever vigilant of your own heart

## The Doctor's Dilemma

### Background

When there is damage inside a person's body, all health practitioners face the same challenge: the damaged area is surrounded by one or more layers that prevent direct interaction with the damaged area.  How does one get at the damaged area?

Some options are:

* Trigger chemical reactions
* Apply surface forces
* Cut them open

Systems need to divided into layers.  It is unavoidable.  Even if a system is not divided into layers, it is probably built on top of other layers and other layers may be built on top of it.

Layers are a two-edged sword.  They compartmentalize, but also obscure.

### Rules

* Don't create tools that get in the way
* Minimize your layers, preferring [flat over nested]($Flat over Nested)
* Make the contents of your layers as accessible as possible
* Design with maintenance in mind, which often involves features that are only used for maintenance

## Temporal Narcissism

> "Those who fail to learn from history are condemned to repeat it" - Winston Churchill

### Rules

* Everyone stands on the shoulders of their predecessors
* Study what others have designed in the past
  * Find cases of what succeeded *and* what failed
* Every tool you use and every tool you create is mortal
* The greatest impact of a design is not the design itself, but its echo in later designs

## Flat over Nested
