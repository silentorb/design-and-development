## The Lofty and the Lowly

### Background

In all of life there is a tension between the lofty and the lowly, the extraordinary and the ordinary.  Systems work best when they are accomplishing amazing things yet are humble.  Reaching for the stars yet keenly aware that the universe is infinitely bigger.  Deepening in understanding and happy to take out the trash.

This equally applies to system design.  The most useful systems are systems that incorporate tremendous insight and discipline, but are humble.

### Rules

* Pursue excellence
* Serve others through your creation
