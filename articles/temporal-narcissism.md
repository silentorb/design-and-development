## Temporal Narcissism

> "Those who fail to learn from history are condemned to repeat it" - Winston Churchill

### Rules

* Everyone stands on the shoulders of their predecessors
* Study what others have designed in the past
  * Find cases of what succeeded *and* what failed
* Every tool you use and every tool you create is mortal
* The greatest impact of a design is not the design itself, but its echo in later designs
