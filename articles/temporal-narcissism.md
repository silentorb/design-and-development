### Background

* Everyone stands on the shoulders of their predecessors
* Every tool you use and every tool you create is [mortal](./mortal-growth.md)
* The greatest impact of a design is not the design itself, but its echo in later designs

### Rules

* Study what others have designed in the past
  * Find cases of what succeeded *and* what failed
