## Composition

Composition is one of the most powerful mechanics in the world.  Through composition, a small set of general tools can be used to construct an infinite variety of specialized tools.

### Rules

* Organize systems into a gradation of general to specific layers
* A root general layer should be a minimal collection of atomic building blocks
* A root general layer should not have shortcuts
  * Shortcuts should be implemented in higher level layers
