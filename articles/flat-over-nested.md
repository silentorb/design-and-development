## Flat over Nested

> Flat is better than nested - The Zen of Python

### Rules

* Prefer flat logic over nested logic when organizing objects of the same level of specificity
  * In other words, minimize nesting except to nest general solutions within specific solutions
* When a problem requires nested logic, a nested solution can sometimes still employ flat data structures
  * For example, a DAG can be represented as a flat collection of references
