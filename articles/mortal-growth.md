## Mortal Growth

> The best code is the code designed to die

### Background

* In the world of biology, organisms grow by replacing old cells with new cells
* Humanity grows by standing on the shoulders of its predecessors
* Any major improvements upon a system require the removal of previous elements
* The more experimental a system, the more it requires temporal stepping-stone components
* Sometimes too much effort is put into short-lived components 
* When a system is monolithic, the replacement of a components easily breaks other components throughout the system
* A system can efficiently handle experimentation and growth when it is designed to have any of it's components replaced

### Rules

* When designing a system, anticipate that system being replaced someday
* Divide a system into smaller parts that can be replaced without breaking other parts of the system
