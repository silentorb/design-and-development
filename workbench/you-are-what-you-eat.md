## Antidotes

> Back in the day when I was playing Friday Night Magic, there was always a wide variety of decks.  Most decks revolved around particular mechanical themes, where the cards had lots of synergy and worked better when played with each other.  Sometimes someone would play a deck with minimal card synergy.  Instead, the deck would be a collection of the most independently strong cards available within a particular color combination.  These were the "Dream Team" decks and at times they were the dominant challengers.
