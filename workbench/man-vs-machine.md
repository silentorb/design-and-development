> "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath." - Mark 2:27b

### Background

* Humanity is creative.  Humanity creates tools to assist humanity and further creation.

* A creation is an extension and reflection of its creator.

* Humanity has a tendency to utilize the reflective-nature of creation and exalt themselves through their creations.

* When the creation of a tool becomes more self than service, the utility of that tool diminishes.

* Pride is a subtle force; felt by all and noticed by few.

* The gravitational force of pride increases in proportion to the excellence of the tool being created.

* Designers should strive to craft excellent systems, but the more they succeed, the more dangerous that success becomes.

### Rules

* Don't shoot low, but know that the higher you climb, the harder it is to keep from falling

* Be ever vigilant of your own heart
