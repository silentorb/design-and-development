## Performance

There is a saying in the programming world that "Premature Optimization is the root of all [kinds] of evil."  Premature optimization is a major pitfall, but deferring all concern for optimization can be a pitfall as well.  This is because all technology has a performance ceiling, and technical decisions can affect the height of that ceiling.
